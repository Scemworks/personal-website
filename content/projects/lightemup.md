# Light Em' Up

Light Em' Up is an electronic Whack-A-Mole game that combines hardware and software elements. I developed the frontend website for score tracking and monitoring game stats, while the core game uses NodeMCU microcontrollers and a Node.js backend.

## Project Components

- NodeMCU-based hardware implementation
- Node.js server backend
- Web frontend for score tracking (my contribution)
- Real-time communication using ntfy.sh

## Technology Stack

- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for score tracking frontend
- ntfy.sh for device communication

## Development Highlights

- Custom circuit design and implementation
- WiFi-based device communication
- Score tracking and display system with web interface
- Responsive web frontend for game statistics

## Setup Requirements

- NodeMCU microcontroller
- WiFi network configuration
- Node.js environment
- Web browser for score tracking
